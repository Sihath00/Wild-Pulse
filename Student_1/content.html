            <h2>Fascinating Facts About Oceans</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>More Than Just Water: Oceans cover about 70% of the Earth's surface, containing 97% of the planet's water. They also hold 97% of the Earth's water supply.</li>
                <li>Deeper Than the Grand Canyon: The deepest part of the ocean is the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. It reaches a depth of about 36,070 feet (10,994 meters), deeper than Mount Everest is tall.</li>
                <li>Home to Ancient Creatures: The ocean is filled with creatures that have been around for millions of years, like the Coelacanth, a fish that was thought to be extinct for 66 million years until it was rediscovered in 1938.</li>
                <li>Underwater Volcanoes: There are more than 1 million known species of plants and animals in the ocean, and scientists believe there may be as many as 9 million species we haven’t discovered yet.</li>
                <li>The Blue Heart of Earth: Oceans are responsible for producing over half of the world's oxygen, thanks to phytoplankton that produce oxygen through photosynthesis.</li>
                <li>Giant Jellyfish: The lion's mane jellyfish is one of the largest jellyfish in the world, with tentacles that can extend to over 120 feet (36.6 meters) long.</li>
                <li>Sounds of the Deep: The sound travels faster in water than in air, which is why some marine animals like whales use sound to communicate and navigate through the ocean.</li>
                <li>A World of Salt: The ocean is salty because it contains dissolved salts from rocks on land that are carried by rivers and deposited into the sea.</li>
                <li>The Longest Mountain Range: The Mid-Ocean Ridge is the longest mountain range in the world, stretching over 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) and winding through all the major oceans.</li>
                <li>Sunken Treasures: An estimated 3 million shipwrecks lie on the ocean floor, holding untold historical, archaeological, and sometimes even valuable treasures.</li>
                <li>Glowing Waters: Some areas of the ocean, like Mosquito Bay in Puerto Rico, have bioluminescent organisms that light up the water at night, creating a magical spectacle.</li>
                <li>A Giant Garbage Patch: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection of marine debris (mostly plastics) in the North Pacific Ocean. It's estimated to be twice the size of Texas.</li>
